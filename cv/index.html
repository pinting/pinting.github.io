            <p style="text-align: justify;">I was born in Hungary in 1996. I got involved with web development during my elementary school years which steered me in the direction of becoming a software engineer.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">In 2014, during my senior year in high school, I was hired to develop an instant messaging system with P2P video and audio calling for a startup company.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">In 2015, I began studying computer engineering in Budapest. At this point, I was focusing on enterprise application development while I was simultaneously becoming more and more interested in the contemporary art scene and video game development. However, it started to seem like my university education had less and less impact on me. I wanted to get some hands-on experience.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">In 2017, I dropped out and became a full-time employee at Accedo, an OTT company. My job involved smart television application development and the construction of internal tools and processes. In my free time, I started to invest more energy into video game development.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">In 2020 I relocated to Guadalajara, Mexico to work at the local Accedo office. The pandemic outbreak had forced all employees of the company to work from home which is where I started coming up with the concept for FreakShow, a point and click adventure game I am currently working on. The idea was to use photographic input to create visually abstract, interactive scenes with an alienated, post-communist aesthetic. The game was displayed at two contemporary art exhibitions at the end of 2020 in Budapest.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">In 2021, I left Accedo and took a creative break from the world of information technology to study philosophy in Cluj-Napoca, Romania.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">I thrive in interdisciplinary environments as my goal is to integrate different fields of art and technology. Due to my expertise in software development, I can provide a solid technical background to any outside-of-the-box art project or bring an artistic flair to more tech-heavy tasks. Whether you are looking for a video game programmer with an artistic flair or a skilled web developer, feel free to contact me.</p>

Using <u>Docker</u>, I could introduce <u>CI for Tizen and WebOS platforms</u> thus saving hundreds of hours of work time per year. During my support years, I had the opportunity to relocate temporarily to Guadalajara, Mexico.</li>
